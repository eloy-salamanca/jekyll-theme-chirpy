After 3 months of intensive preparation, I’m happy to say that I passed out [Google Cloud Certified - Professional Cloud Architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect)

It wasn’t very easy at all, so I had to do my best, but I must admit that it worth it because it forced me to get a deep insight into how Google Cloud works before take it.

## Guidelines
I followed up different official sources of information, and above all, practiced the most I could; that would be the very best advice I can give you: practice, practice, practice; in short:

1. Get used to the [Exam Guide](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect/)
2. Enrolled on a learning path in **Coursera**; I did the equivalent to the current [Cloud Architecture with GCP Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/gcp-cloud-architect) and [Preparing for Professional Cloud Arhitect Exam](https://www.coursera.org/learn/preparing-cloud-professional-cloud-architect-exam)
3. I made as many **Qwiklabs** as I could, as least [Challenge GCP Architecture](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/47), [Cloud Architecture](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/24) and [Google Cloud Solutions I: Scaling Your Infrastructure](https://www.qwiklabs.com/quests/36)
4. Have a review again to [the online documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/) and [Sample Case Studies](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/professional-cloud-architect/).

As an introduction to what you can expect and how to face this challenge, I highly recommend a very useful article from whom I consider my mentor: [**David das Neves**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddasneves/), called: [How to pass - Google Professional Cloud Architect](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-pass-google-professional-cloud-architect-david-das-neves/)

Last and not least, as Google released [The 2019 Cloud certification challenge](https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/cloud-certification/#!/), I took advantage of it, so I got discounts on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Qwiklabs](https://qwiklabs.com/) (and of course a $100 voucher to spend on the Google Store ;-).

Although is closed for now, you can visit that website and [**register as interested**](https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/cloud-certification/#training), so that you can get access to advantages and discounts whenever they start a new session (surely they will do soon!!)

## Conclusion
To sum up, I will tell you that you will have to roll up a sleeve, but the knowledge you will earn along the way will allow you to get hands-on experience to design the future of the environments for your company with confidence.
