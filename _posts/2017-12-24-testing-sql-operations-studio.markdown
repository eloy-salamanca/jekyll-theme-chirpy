Last Nov 15th, [SQL Operations Studio was launched in preview](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2017/11/15/announcing-sql-operations-studio-for-preview/), and as it looks pretty interesting, I wanted to test it asap; here's what to test in Windows

* Download [SQL Operations Studio (preview) for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862648)
* Browse to the downloaded file and extract it
* Run `\sqlops-windows\sqlops.exe`

I didn't need to install anything; it is fully ready to use!!

Cool interface, full responsive and fast. Nice job. Time to add to my toolbox.
