Incoming **Tuesday, August 28**, Windows 2008 SP2 will be moved to a rollup model (servicing model), and initial preview of monthly quality update will be delivered.

After this change, Windows 2008 SP2 will follow up later Windows versions, what implies:

> **A security only quality update**: Starting September 2018, this security only update will be released on Update Tuesday, commonly referred to as “Patch Tuesday”, the second Tuesday of the month.
> **A security monthly quality rollup**: Starting September 2018, this monthly rollup will be released on Update Tuesday, also known as “Patch Tuesday”, the second Tuesday of the month.
> **A preview of the monthly quality rollup**: Starting August 2018, the preview rollup will be released on the third Tuesday of the month.

To sum up, there will be only one quality release each month on “Second Patch Tuesday” (only update and rollup) and a preview rollup on the “Third Patch Tuesday”, and Windows Server 2008 SP2 will follow up this servicing model, starting next **Tuesday, August 28**
