Have you ever change computer and went mad trying to recap all required installers for your daily work?
Me too, so I’m trying to summarize here most commons installers that I usually need.
Feel free to add suggestions to this list, so it would become more useful!

If still not on win10, you need this: [Windows Management Framework 5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616) Last PowerShell version, essential to access PSGallery and install-modules

```

### Azure Stack (up to 1.3.0)

#### Connected Scenario (Internet connectivity available)
If you're willing to play with Azure Stack, you're going to need this, it's necessary to allow subsequent installation of Azure Stack compatible AzureRM modules, since they are installed by leveraging API version profiles.
```powershell
Install-Module -Name AzureRm.BootStrapper
Use-AzureRmProfile -Profile 2017-03-09-profile -Force
```

PS: In case you receive any error messages at this point, open File Explorer, navigate to C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules and to C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\WindowsPowerShellModules, identify any folders starting with Azure, and retry running Use-AzureRmProfile cmdlet.
```powershell
# Install Module Version 1.3.0 if Azure Stack is running 1804 at minimum
Install-Module –Name AzureStack –RequiredVersion 1.3.0
# Install Module Version 1.2.11 if Azure Stack is running a lower version than 1804
Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.2.11
```

To confirm AzureRM and AzureStack available modules:
```powershell
Get-Module -ListAvailable | Where-Object Name -like 'Azure*'
```

#### Disconnected or partially connected scenario (limited Internet connectivity)

1. Sign in to a computer with internet connectivity and use following script to download AzureRM, AzureStack packages:

```powershell
$Path = ""

Save-Package -ProviderName NuGet `
  -Source https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2 -Name AzureRM `
  -Path $Path -Force `
  -RequiredVersion 1.2.11
  
Save-Package -ProviderName NuGet `
  -Source https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2 -Name AzureStack `
  -Path $Path -Force `
  -RequiredVersion 1.3.0
```

PS: If you are not running Azure Stack 1804, change **requiredversion** parameter to 1.2.11

2. Copy downloaded packages to USB device
3. Copy packages to the workstation
4. Register default repository

```powershell
$SourceLocation = "[local packages]"
$RepoName = "MyNuGetSource"
Register-PSRepository -Name $RepoName -SourceLocation $SourceLocation `
-InstallationPolicy Trusted

Install-Module AzureRM -Repository $RepoName

Install-Module AzureStack -Repository $RepoName
```

### Azure Stack Tools
This has to be installed from GitHub
```powershell
Set-Location -Path 'C:\'
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-Tools/archive/master.zip -OutFile master.zip
Expand-Archive master.zip -DestinationPath . -Force
Set-Location –Path C:\AzureStack-Tools-master
